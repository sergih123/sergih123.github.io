    <h1>Reasoning for chosen Accessiblity</h1>
    <h3>We take the accessibility of our website seriously</h3>
    <h2>List-less Navs</h2>
    <p>According to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/navigation-in-lists-to-be-or-not-to-be/">this article</a> 
    a blind person, Reinhard suggests not using lists for navigation, and instead using divs and spans.
He argues that quote:</p>
    <blockquote>    I think everyone in the room scratched their heads when this was said. One of the first things you’re 
        taught about coding is how to structure a navigation and this is normally done with an unordered list. 
        This list structure, however, is not conducive to the screen reader’s logic. The span tag is not recognized 
        by the screen reader, so it is one of the ways you can simplify your content for accessibility.</blockquote>

The UN Convention also stipulates that the design of products, environments, programmes and services should enable their use by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialised design. Such ‘universal design’ should not exclude assistive devices for particular groups of persons with disabilities, where this is needed.

Those principles of accessibility are translated into testable success criteria, such as those forming the basis of the European standard EN&nbsp;301 549&nbsp;V1.1.2 ‘Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe’ (2015-04) (European standard EN&nbsp;301 549&nbsp;V1.1.2 (2015-04)), via harmonised standards and a common methodology to test the conformity of content on websites and mobile applications with those principles.

Exceptions to compliance with the accessibility requirements due to the disproportionate burden that they impose should not go beyond what is strictly necessary in order to limit that burden with respect to the particular content concerned in each individual case. Measures that would impose a disproportionate burden should be understood as measures that would impose an excessive organisational or financial burden on a public sector body, or would jeopardise the body's capacity to either fulfil its purpose or to publish information needed for or relevant to its tasks and services, while taking into account the likely resulting benefit or detriment for citizens, in particular persons with disabilities. Only legitimate reasons should be taken into account in any assessment of the extent to which the accessibility requirements cannot be met because they would impose a disproportionate burden. Lack of priority, time or knowledge should not be considered as legitimate reasons. Likewise, there should not be any legitimate reasons for not procuring or developing software systems to manage content on websites and mobile applications in an accessible manner, since sufficient and advisory techniques are available to make those systems meet the accessibility requirements set out in this Directive.</p>
